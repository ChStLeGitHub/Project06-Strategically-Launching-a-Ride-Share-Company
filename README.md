# Project 06: Data Collection and Storage
 
**Objective:** Analyze Chicago's taxi and ride-sharing market by identifying the top neighborhoods for dropoffs, assessing the rankings of Chicago-based taxi companies based on ride frequency, and investigating the impact of weather conditions on ride duration to support Zuber, a new ride-sharing company, in making strategic decisions for their launch in the city.

**Accomplishments:** I identified the top 10 neighborhoods in Chicago in terms of number of taxi dropoffs. Furthermore, I determined the top 10 most requested taxi companies. Lastly, I did a one-tailed hypothesis test to support Zuber's hunch that taxi rides from the Loop (neighborhood) to O'Hare International Airport take, on average, longer on rainy Saturdays than on dry Saturdays.

**Skills Demonstrated:** SQL, descriptive statistics, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation
